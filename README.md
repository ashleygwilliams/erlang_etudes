erlang_etudes
=============

<p>i am learning erlang via the etudes, with 'introducing erlang' and 'learn you some erlang' as companion texts</p>

<p>the etudes and code from introducing erlang are in the chapter folders</p>

<p>the `learn_you` folder is full of exercises i made up for myself while reading 'learn you some erlang'</p>
